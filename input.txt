You have been given a complete binary tree rooted at r. Each edge e has a positive length `e. The distance between the root r and any leaf is the total length of all the edges along the path from r to the leaf. As you can imagine, the distance between the root r and any two distinct leaves can be quite different. Your task is to increase the length of some of the edges such that in the resulting tree, distance between the root and all the leaves will be the same. Note that you can only elongate edges and cannot shrink them. Design a greedy algorithm that achieves this goal such that the sum of all edge lengths in the final tree is minimized. (Hint: recursion and greedy)
