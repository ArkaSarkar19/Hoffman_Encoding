# Hoffman_Encoding / Fano_Shannon Encoding and Decoder
Huffman and Fano_shannon text compression in java. Place the text to be compressed in the input.txt file and then run huffman_encoder.java or FanoShannon.java and the corresponding character mapping is generated in the mapping.txt file along with the encoded script in the encoded.txt file. 
To Decode any encoded file run the huffman_decoder.java script and the output is generated in the terminal of the program.

NOTE : TO HANDLE LARGE TEXT FILES its advisable to run it on the huffman_encoder as it is a iterative algorithm while FanoShannon is a recursive algorithm so LARGE Texts may throw a Stack Overflow Error.
